description=\n\
Wado RS client simulator. It supports retrieving Study, Series, Instance, Metadata and Bulkdata. One may choose to specify \
multiple urls as arguments. Each of the objects of the Study/series shall be saved to the current working directory \
or the directory selected by user as <uid>-001.dicom, <uid>-002.dicom and so on. The uid is determined \
based on the url(s) specified. For eg. if study is retrieved the Study IUID will be used, if the url is for series \
retrieval then Series IUID shall be used. The extension of individual parts is determined by content type of each part. \n\-\n\
